Crime & Punishment by [Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky) is an absolutely incredible novel. I was captivated the entire time and was practically screaming during the intense parts. It's emotionally devastating, but also intellectually demanding, with a strong philosophical undertone.

The story follows Raskolnicov, a destitute former student in 19th-century St. Petersburg who convinces himself that murdering a pawnbroker is morally justified for the "greater good". He believes "extraordinary individuals" may transgress moral law if the outcome benefits humanity.

But once the crime is committed, the theory collapses. He feels neither liberated nor righteous. Instead, he begins to unravel. Guilt, paranoia, and psychological turmoil consume him as police pressure mounts and his relationships with family and friends force him to confront what he has become. The novel ends not with vindication, but with confession to the police, exile to Siberia, and the beginning of a painful moral rebirth.

The murder scene is especially striking because of how unplanned and dissociated it feels. Raskolnikov doesn't act like a calculating mastermind. He moves almost unconsciously, as if swept along by momentum rather than intention. The act feels less like a controlled execution of a plan and more like a psychological collapse.

The novel's central tension is clear: Raskolnikov believes he can justify the murder through reason, yet he cannot live with it. His suffering exposes a deep disconnect between abstract moral reasoning and the human moral conscience. Even if an act can be justified on paper, it may still violate something fundamental in us. Dostoevsky's challenge is implicit but devastating: if a moral theory cannot be endured psychologically, in what sense is it true at all?

That's what makes the book feel timeless. Most people believe they're moral, but for many this confidence rests on moral theory rather than lived testing. Imagine a father whose child has cancer and the only way to raise money for treatment in time is to sell drugs - at that point, moral theory loses its clarify. Dostoevsky shows that morality cannot be known with certainty in advance. It is revealed only under pressure, where even our most confident ethical beliefs begin to break down.

As a software engineer who’s explored frontend, backend, and infrastructure, I’ve been tempted by the allure of the "fullstack developer" title. But before chasing that, I’m reminded of a quote from [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus):

> "Consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake anything."

It’s a reminder to weigh the challenges, trade-offs, and potential chaos before committing to a path. So, is chasing the fullstack dream truly worth it?

## The Dream

Being a fullstack developer sounds appealing: switching between frontend code, backend APIs, and infrastructure tasks - all in a day’s work. It paints the picture of a versatile engineer who can tackle problems across the stack.

For someone like me, who loves learning and exploring new tools, it’s an exciting vision.

## The Reality

But here’s the caveat. Fullstack development often come with a long list of responsibilities across multiple layers of the stack. It’s not just writing code - it’s understanding infrastructure, managing data, maintaining pipelines, and juggling different tools and frameworks.

The problem isn’t the variety itself - it’s the expectation to stay on top of all of it. When you're constantly shifting gears, it becomes harder to build real depth in any one area. Over time, that can feel less like flexibility and more like fragmentation.

Being adaptable is a strength, but trying to cover everything at once can lead to diminishing returns. There’s a difference between knowing your way around the stack and being expected to master it all.

## The "T" Shaped Solution

Then I stumbled across the concept of the [T-Shaped Engineer](https://alexkondov.com/the-t-shaped-engineer/) (seriously read Alex’s blog - it’s excellent). That’s when I discovered the idea: specialise deeply in one area while maintaining broad knowledge across others. It’s a more sustainable approach, letting you excel without losing your sanity.

## Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?

Fullstack development sounds glamorous, but it’s important to consider the iceberg below the surface. If you thrive on constant learning and chaos, it might be for you. But if you prefer mastering a craft while staying balanced, the T-shaped path is a wiser choice.
